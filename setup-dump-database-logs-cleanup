# truncate :
 Shrink or extend the size of each FILE to the specified size

A FILE argument that does not exist is created.
If a FILE is larger than the specified size, the extra data is lost.  
If a FILE is shorter, it is extended and the sparse extended part (hole) reads as zero bytes.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

**c, --no-createdo not create any files**

**-o, --io-blocks treat SIZE as number of IO blocks instead of bytes**

**-r, --reference=RFILE base size on RFILE**

**-s, --size=SIZE set or adjust the file size by SIZE bytes**
